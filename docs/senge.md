# Systems Thinking

Climate Change is happening. It is a concrete example of systems thinking in action.

Most people are familiar with system thinking processes of feedback and feedforward and the affects on the overall system.

The climate metaphor can be transferred to business. It is used to provide the foundation of good work that leads to sustainable competitive advantage. Teams are like weather cells. Each is unique. Blanket organisational initiatives are as welcome as carbon or methane emissions. (Diesel Don relentlessly follows his product roadmap in a big lorry that is too large for the country lanes he tries to drive down. Ermentrude is farting around in HR.)

There are many different types of system thinking. I have selected Peter Senge's Fifth Discipline. His identification of the elements needed for learning organisations provide a metaphorical link to the cognitive crops in the corporate eco system.

1. Personal Mastery
2. Mental Models
3. Team Learning
4. Shared Vision
5. Systems Thinking

I like the way that Senge starts with stories and breaks them into loops and causal analysis. Stories are important. They are even better when they are told as scenes in a play, movie or opera. Opera as you are aware is the Italian word for work. There is a loop I will return to when we examine lean scenes.

To start we shall look at the hot air of business change.
