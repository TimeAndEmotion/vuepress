These musings are intended to make work more enjoyable and valuable.

There are more interpretations for value in the business lexicon than Eskimos have words for snow.


I will look at climate first then run through the following:

1. Psychological contracts and how they change
2. Brain and Body model updates
3. Aesthetics - the bits that schools do not teach
4. Role based work: practice, rehearsal and performance
5. Soundtracks of life and work

I will pull the threads together and finish off with an updated and relevant way of working that provides us all with value. Enjoy.
