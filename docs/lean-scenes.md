# Lean Scenes

Lean scenes are new to most people.

As Agile evolves the focus has started to shift away from the customer. Are you working to personas?

If you do not have agreed customer personas you are not working in true Agile fashion because User Stories can not be validated.

Another aspect to consider is the addition of business value to the main Agile monitoring tools. This is inevitable as Agile moves from tech teams to mainstream business. The problem is that there is no agreed definition of value. This leads to confusion, distrust, lower morale and strategic drift.

Lean scenes are a way of showing the different perspectives of the main players and identifying the pinch points in information flow. Removing these blockers is of primary importance.

Lean scenes educate, engage, enable and empower staff. They provide:

1. Concise problem and solution statements
2. Explanations of the main player perspectives
3. Fast ways of identifying and removing pinch points in information flow
4. A starting point to provide the business case for marginal gains and scalable success.

It is usual for a lean scene to be written in under two minutes and finessed in less than ten minutes.

The mindset of writing a lean scene is an opportunity to use gamma waves: to get in the flow zone<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> and do something that is good for the self and group<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>.

It is simple to convert the lean scene to a quantitative business case using A4#.
