# Lean Scenes

Lean scenes are new to most people.

A simple test to determine if you need them is - Are you working to personas?

If you do not have agreed customer personas you are not working in true Agile fashion because User Stories can not be validated.

Lean scenes educate, engage, enable and empower staff. They provide:

1. Concise problem and solution statements
2. Explanations of the main player perspectives
3. Fast ways of identifying and removing pinch points in information flow
4. A starting point to provide the business case for marginal gains and scalable success.

It is usual for a lean scene to be written in under two minutes and finessed in less than ten minutes.

It is simple to convert the lean scene to a business case using A4#.
