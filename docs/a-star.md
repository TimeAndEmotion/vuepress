# A* - Product SatNav

We are all familiar with product roadmaps. But the map is not the territory.

The territory to be mapped in product development is the decision making process in the business. It is more akin to the A* algorithm used by SatNav to create the best road-map:

f(n) =g(n) + h(n)

where:

n is the node
g(n) is cost to next node
h(n) is an heuristic of the cost to the end from the next node

Smaller organisations tend to move like cars motorways and larger orgainsations are convoys caught on A and B roads. Entrepreneurs are like motorcyclists on the B roads. They can skip through the convoys when the time is right. At other times they have to patiently hold station.
