Most commercial organisations try to scale.

They measure and try to manage by assessing where they are on maturity scales.

They lift and learn the theory of models that are on trend and try to implement it. It is very boring and people switch off. There is an alternative way.

The songs are presented in such a way that the player picks up the underlying scales almost by osmosis. It is fun and natural. It can be paced for individuals of differing abilities and dedication.
