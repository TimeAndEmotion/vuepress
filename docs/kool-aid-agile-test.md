# Persona Non Starters

If you do not have personas how can you know the end user.

If you do not have personas why are you working with user stories. The reality check is - you are not doing agile. You need a new way of working to meet the political needs of your organisation.

Reliance on Business Analysis and Product Owners is not the answer. They most likely do not know the true business needs either. It is usually a case of mistaken identity... Your work is internally focussed. YOur market is not the user but the people in your business. Your work is like a soap opera. Very little character development.

You are better off using lean scenes.

Lean scenes identify the key players in the set.
