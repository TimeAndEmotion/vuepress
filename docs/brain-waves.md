There is also the polyvagal theory that shows how gut-feel and intuition originate from our bodies. It is a scientific approach that appears to explain chakras.

There is a lot of research in this field. New discoveries are replacing the way we think of brain models. The 'reptile, mammal, human' and 'logical-left, creative-right' models have been shown to be wrong. What is now emerging is on point. It will inevitably change as new discoveries are made.

Being able to change modes at will is essential to future-proof careers and perhaps also offset early onset...

I use a variety of techniques:

1. Concentrate and block out other stuff. My wife thinks I have developed Asberger's
2. Looking at events through an aesthetic filter.
3. Music that modulates is a way of quickening thinking
4. Taking in a new painting and researching it is an easy way out
5. Some books or poetry can move me - but they are few and far between
6. I apply critical, creative and cognitive techniques from the library<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> and slot machine<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

Mental flossing is as regular as brushing your teeth.
