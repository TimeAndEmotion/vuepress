Each has a frequency and associated originating point in the brain.

There is also the polyvagal theory that shows how gut-feel and intuition originate from our bodies. It is a scientific approach that appears to explain chakras.

There is a lot of research in this field. New discoveries are replacing the way we think of brain models. The 'reptile, mammal, human' and 'logical-let, creative-right' models have been shown to be wrong.

Being able to change modes at will is essential to future-proof careers.
