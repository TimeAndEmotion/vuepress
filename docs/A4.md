# A4#

A4# is a way of converting lean scenes to business cases.

A4# is an extension of the Toyota Production System [TPS] A3 Thinking technique. It has been shrunk to fit on one side of A4 and has a # so you can post it on your communication channels. I am trendy for a fossil.

A4# can be done by your self or in a group that has the necessary experience. The group members can be from different parts of the organisation.
