# A4#

A4# is a way of converting lean scenes to business cases. It is the quantitative version of the scene. It addresses time and cost.

A4# is an extension of the Toyota Production System [TPS] A3 Thinking technique. It has been shrunk to fit on one side of A4 and has a '#' so you can post it on your communication channels. (It is an old man's attempt to be trendy for a fossil.)

A4# can be done by your self or in a group that has the necessary experience. The group members can be from different parts of the organisation. 

A4# uses the Scan Design Deliver Value learning cycle to lay out concise problem statements and present plans to address them.
