# Aesthetics

Arthur Schopenhauer was a misogynistic misery guts. What a guy!

(He inspired Nietszche who uses "Will to live" as the reference for "Will to power": a treatise on the ability to think like Dyonisius. The Nazi's later reinterpreted it in Appolonian was to justify their philosophies.)

Schopenhauer<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> listed the aesthetics below:

1. Music
2. Sculpture and Art
3. Poetry and Prose
4. Landscape Architecture
5. Architecture

Opera contains all the above: The music can be listened to by itself. The libretto tells the story that is supported by the tunes. The sculpture and art decorate the sets sit in can incorporate landscapes and architecture. Each scene is made of some or all of the elements.

The basic human condition is the same as Shakespeare observed it and showed it through his plays. Is use of rhythm in the poetry removed the need for supporting music. All the world was a stage.

Technology has moved things on a bit - Movies replace opera: All the World is a screen

What can we use from aesthetics to make work better?

We will take a brief look at some of the aesthetic techniques and tools that we can copy and apply to work.

As this is not in the common managerial training or explicit in standard operating procedures it is unlikely that your boss will have any motivation to help. You need to do it for yourself.
