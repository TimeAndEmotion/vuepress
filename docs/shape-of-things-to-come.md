# Shape Estimation - Personal

Overview

For most people they can do the work that they have to. Estimation however is like Al Capone's taxes. Once the estimate is given people anticipate it will be met. If you have been stood up on a date or let down by a tradesman you know trust evaporates.

Improving estimation is the key. Building on True Discipline it is best to estimate how much value you are going to receive from the work. Once you know that you can appreciate the expectations of others depending on you.

The easiest way I find to estimate is different to yours. I use the SDDV cycle. It makes me think of the parts of the job that I do not see using complexity or experience.
