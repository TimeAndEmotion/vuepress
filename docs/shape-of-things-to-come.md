# Shape of things to come

Work is modeled similarly but slightly differently to what you are used to. The reason is that we see a lot of delivery work being transferred to AI in the coming years.

This can be scary. Witness the fact that it took Gary Kasparov to come to terms with being beaten by a machine.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

Improving estimation is the key. Building on True Discipline it is best to estimate how much value you are going to receive from the work. Once you know that you can appreciate the expectations of others depending on you.

The easiest way I find to estimate is different to yours. I use the SDDV cycle. It makes me think of the parts of the job that I do not see using complexity or experience.
