Henry Wood the classical composer and conductor who made the Proms has troubles with his orchestra.

During rehearsals the timpani and triangle players would leave the room and sneak off to the pub.
Section leaders would send their proxies to rehearsal! 

Pop groups are renowned for their spats. they may be tight but they also fight

Fleetwood Mac making Rumours, Richard and Linda Thompson onstage, the Everly Brothers & The Gallacher brothers in Oasis. I liked the Beautiful South who split up due to musical similarites.
