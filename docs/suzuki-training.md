# Suzuki Training Philosophy

The Suzuki Method<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a recognised way of learning musical instruments. I have used this with guitar pupils. Some went on to study music at college and others won gigs at Shepherd's Bush Empire and Ministry of Sound.

The technique gets people playing what they want quickly. The theory can be dropped in later. That sounds back to front for most minds but it is becoming prevalent in the businesses I work in. Probably because I teach it


Suzuki's music learning method is not too dissimilar from the way I had to relearn computer programming as I recovered from meningitis which, for a period of time after the coma, I had the ten symptoms of dementia.sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
