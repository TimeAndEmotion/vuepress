# Suzuki Training Philosophy

The Suzuki Method<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a recognised way of learning musical instruments. I have used this with guitar pupils. Some went on to study music at college and others won gigs at Shepherd's Bush Empire and Ministry of Sound.

The technique got students playing what they wanted quickly so that they could impress their peers. Lessons were: songs first, scales second. For most people the value is applying learning by doing something they enjoy. The kudos is good too.

That sounds back to front for most of us who had to go to school - but it is becoming prevalent in businesses. Staff are more likely to align with technology and methods that are on trend - at the expense of the corporate ways of work.

Suzuki's music learning method is not too dissimilar from the way I had to relearn computer programming as I recovered from meningitis which, for a period of time after the coma, I had the ten symptoms of dementia.<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>

Today it is easy to find solutions to technical problems on the internet. Technical team members search, copy, paste and amend code from online repositories. It is more akin to the typing pools of yesteryear.

Video lessons and MOOCs teach how to build example systems that show off the core techniques of the relevant technology.

There are several issues that are prevalent in established organisations.

1. The staff want to use the latest on-trend paradigms, techniques and tools to keep their market value high.
2. Organisations with legacy systems may not have the ability to offer those opportunities.
3. The ease of making commonly used systems is increasing thus allowing new comers to threaten sustainability.

Suzuki training can be used to provide opportunities for staff to learn 'cross over' tech.

On the job training can be carried out using _etudes_ that provide the skills the staff want and the stability the organisation needs.
