# Psychological Contracts

The psychological contract<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. is a tacit, unspoken agreement of what workers expect from their organisation and what the bosses expect in return.

When the two are at odds there is a need for true discipline to increase the value to both parties.

**True Discipline**
By “true discipline”, I do not mean a mere muscular response to orders. The
latter comes from the training of body and wits; the former derives from a
decision of the intellect which is based largely upon self-interest. I think that
one of the general mistakes made by the military body is that because soldiering
is a patriotic calling, it is regarded as somehow base to put self-interest
foremost in appealing to the judgement and imagination of the soldier. Yet it
is undeniable that a willingness to accept the system is the first step in the
soldier’s personal advancement. As his success enhances his appreciation of
the military life, he grows in knowledge and in a willing ability to apply it.
These are the constituent elements of the true discipline upon which an army
is finally dependent.

There is a typical generational squabble going on that I hope to shine some light on on the next section.
