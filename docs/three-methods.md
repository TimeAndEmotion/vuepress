# Role based method comparisons

This will, on a first read, sound a bit loopy.

Work is role based. We all play our parts in the workplaces.

There are three main acting methods:
1. Disney
2. Stanislavski
3. Brecht


### Disney
Walt Disney had three personas: dreamer, realist and critic. They can be seen in the way that Disney/Pixar use three writing teams to cater for children, teens and parents to produce family entertainment. Without wishing to appear demeaning similar categories can be made in organisations: teams, operations and strategists taken the equivalent of the familial roles.

### Stanislavski
Stanislavski formalised the way that actors prepare for theatrical roles. in his eponymous method. Many others followed and expanded on his work for movies. Audiences were not expected to think. They were meant to believe that the action was real.

It is apparent from many demonstrations that software development teams treat the audience like a movie audience. They expect, and receive, suspended disbelief. That is fine until the final act when there is no working system. Brecht provides a better way.

### Brecht
Brecht hit back agains Stanislavski and classic theatre with his Epic theatre. The actors were helped to be aware of the characters and to make the audience think and subsequently take action on social levels.

The business users should be like actors with a mission to change their own perceptions as well as the audiences. The reason is that for the time being the User Journey is going to change: "Don't Make me think" will be suffixed by "Make me feel"

### When to use the appropriate techniques
Disney is good when you need to allow your imagination free reign. Cartoon capers abound when the logical laws are relaxed. Remember that Disney/Pixar use this approach. If it is good enough for them...

Stanislavski classical methods are everywhere in large 'Soap Opera' organisations.

Brecht is more prevalent in start-up organisations where there is a desire to change things and move audiences to action.

You can find examples of how to integrate the above methods in the creative techniques library.
